A calculator to see how much you've made off of Bitcoin investments

---

After the recent dips and rises in the market, I thought it would be cool to have a calculator to see how much I've earned and lost (mostly earned ;) )

Anyway, there are a myriad of little programs out there that do this, but I thought it would be a good project to deal with some APIs, simple calculations, and functions in Python.

There is a rather large limitation currently: currently, the CoinGecko API only allows historical data to be referenced from the last 365 days on the Demo plan. I'd like to look at ways to improve this in the future, but that's where it's out right now.
